# INNOPROG Administration
## Description
This software was developed by order for INNOPROG Company (Programming school with the completely new way of providing useful information. It helps ambitious students to improve their programming skills and find their way into IT field) to collect data, calculate and generate attendance list and monthly income statement. It also can provide information about office hours for each teacher depending on their permissions given.  By creating this app, I have erased some major problems of building your own business â€“ creating the most simple and efficient way to control enormous amount of information.  The application is connected with a private database and takes from there what users need. It is not only made for one person, but for all the team members to have an instant access for payment information, their office hours and salary.
